# Glozzom

Glozzom is my learning project.

It is a static webpage which is built using bootstrap and ekko-lightbox libraries.

## Notes

1. Scss folder is just for reference as **only Css folder is required for styling** of the webpage.
2. Styling is developed with SaSS and those files were compiled with Koala.
3. Commented out section is also for the reference.
